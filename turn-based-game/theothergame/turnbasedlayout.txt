General mechanics:
 - Once the boss is dead, the map is won
 - Once a player is dead, it cannot be revived (but will be back in the next map)
 - At the end of every round, the hidden player will do something either good or bad, with lesser odds at the start, and more often towards the end
 - Magic can be used to heal or damage
 - Hard modes will involve friendly fire, and player remaining dead for the rest of the game
 - Multiplayer will allow for someone else to control hidden player
 - Special game modes will involve playing as the hidden player, and a multiplayer battle royale
